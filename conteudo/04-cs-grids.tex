\chapter{Cubed-sphere grids}
\label{chp-cs-grids}

The cubed-sphere grid was originally proposed by \citet{sadourny:1972} and was 
reinvestigated by \citet{ronchi:1996} and \citet{rancic:1996}. 
As is usual for Planotic grids, we start with a Platonic solid, in this case, a cube, 
which is circumscribed in a sphere. We then project its faces onto the sphere.
The original cubed-sphere, called the equidistant cubed-sphere, was proposed by 
\citet{sadourny:1972} but resulted in a non-uniform grid.
