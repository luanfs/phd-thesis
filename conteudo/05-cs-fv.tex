\chapter{Cubed-sphere finite-volume methods}
\label{chp-cs-fv}
In this chapter, we demonstrate the application of the dimension splitting method,
presented in Chapter \ref{chp-2d-fv}, to solve the advection equation on the cubed-sphere based on \citet{putman:2007}.
One significant difference is that on the cubed-sphere, special attention must be given to the stencils near the cube edges.
Additionally, when employing ghost cell layers, the flux at the cube edges is computed twice,
requiring treatment to ensure a unique value in order to achieve mass conservation.
