\chapter{Code availability and technical considerations}
\label{anexo-code}
The codes needed for this work have been openly built on GitHub. 
The PPM implementation for the one-dimensional advection equation used in Chapter \ref{chp-1d-fv} is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/FV3_adv_1D}.

The dimension splitting method implementation used in Chapter \ref{chp-2d-fv} is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/FV3_adv_2D}.

The cubed-sphere code used in Chapter \ref{chp-cs-grids}, \ref{chp-cs-fv} and \ref{chp-cs-swm} is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/FV3_container}.
This code was executed using Docker, utilizing the containerized version of the SHiELD model developed by \citet{cheng:2022}
(\url{https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/shield-in-a-box/}, last accessed on March 27th, 2024).

%The ENDGame shallow-water solver used in Chapter \ref{chp-cs-swm}  is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/endgame}.

All these codes are written in Fortran, and the output graphs were generated using Python3.

The numerical experiments conducted in this study were primarily performed on the ybytu machine from Labmap
