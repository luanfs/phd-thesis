\chapter{Code availability and technical considerations}
\label{anexo-code}

The codes needed for this work have been built openly at GitHub. 
The PPM implementation for the one-dimensional advection equation used in Chapter 
\ref{chp-1d-fv} is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/FV3_adv_1D}.

The dimension splitting method implementation used in Chapter 
\ref{chp-2d-fv} is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/FV3_adv_2D}.

All these code are written in Fortran and the output graphs were generated using Python3.
