\section{Finite-difference estimates}
\label{anexo-fd}
This Section aims to prove all finite-difference error estimations 
used throughout this appendix.
All the proves are very simple and consist of applying Taylor's expansions,
as it is usual when computing the accuracy order of many numerical schemes.
